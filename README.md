Mining timing is a script focused around deaths and survivals during the day and an important contemplation of wether you want to die or not. It was created during Clocktober of 2024 by Moll (@mollofpower) and Indigo (@indigocha0s).

# Lapidary
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5202bdda-d57f-45b3-9767-44358f033500" alt="lapidary_good" width="300" height="300">

> On your 1st day, you may visit the Storyteller to privately learn a character type & some that neighbour it clockwise or anticlockwise.

*Such beutiful gems. A little amethyst, small piexes of ruby, and one sizable emerald.*

**The Lapidary inspects some of what is around the mine.**
- The Lapidary can learn any number of character types in a row.
- It is reccomended to give between half and a third of the grimoire. Generally 3 or more for a better experience.
- Learning about some character types is a lot stronger, if you show the Demon it is generally reccomended to show less other players.

# Outsider

## Conservationist
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a38f8a5-8d94-4f24-81aa-9a55a937c946" alt="conservationist_good" width="300" height="300">

> Once per game, if a player would die, they don't & another might die instead.

*Leave us alone, don't break this down. Our home is on the line.*

### **The Conservationist tries to make sure the mining operation stops.**
- The Conservationist can prevent a player from dying at any time, day or night.
- When a death is prevented, the storyteller can choose another to die but doesn't have to.
- We reccomend using the ability during the earlier days, using it later can feel unfair as the players had little power to prevent it. 

### __How to run__

At any time a player dies, you may decide that they don't. Do not declare that this happened. If you do, mark the Conservationist with the **No Ability** reminder. You may also decide that another player dies instead. If this is during the day, immediately declare that the other player has died. If this is during the night, remove the **Dead** reminder that was placed on the protected player and if you chose that another dies, mark them with that **Dead** reminder. Wait until dawn to declare which players died during the night. (Do not say how.)


## Moonshiner
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/772aba6f-9074-497a-b405-a367736c5181" alt="moonshiner_good" width="300" height="300">

> 1 of the Demons alive good neighbours is drunk.

*Come take a sip, homemade to heighten our spirits.*

### **The Moonshiner hands out drinks... Illegally.**
- The Moonshiner only makes 1 player drunk at a time.
- The 2 closest alive good neighbours of the Demon can be, skipping over dead or evil players.
- If the drunk player dies, only then does a new player become drunk.
- If the Moonshiner dies, the player is no longer drunk.

### __How to run__
While preparing the first night, mark one of the Demons good neighbours with the Moonshiner’s **Drunk** reminder. This player is drunk.

If the player marked with the Moonshiners **Drunk** reminder dies, turns evil or stops neighbouring the Demon, remove the Moonshiner's **Drunk** reminder. Mark one of the Demons good neighbours with the Moonshiner’s **Drunk** reminder.

If the Moonshiner dies, remove their **Drunk** reminder.

## Roamer

> If an evil player is executed, tonight, they may guess you: if correct, a player dies tomorrow.

*Round and round the place we go. Finding friend and many foe.*

### **The Roamer travels around rousing monsters from their sleep.**
- The executed evil player may guess even if they did not die.
- The evil player wakes immediately to guess.
- The Roamer can kill a dead or protected player to sink the kill though this should generally only be done if it would help evil.
- If the Roamer dies, no players can die from it's ability then on, even guesses made when the Roamer lived.

### __How to run__

If an evil player is executed, mark them as **Hunting Tonight**.

During that night, wake the player marked **Hunting Tonight**, they point at a player. Put them to sleep. If they pointed at the Roamer, mark the Roamer **Monsters roused**.

If the Roamer is marked **Monsters Roused**, at any point during the day choose a player to die. Immediately declare that the player has died. Remove the **Monsters Roused** reminder. 

At dawn remove the **Hunting Tonight** reminder.

## Counterfeiter
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/116e9ad4-a5ef-4191-be58-6725cd19bc22" alt="counterfeiter_good" width="300" height="300">

> 2 players can't register as their alignment or character to Townsfolk. If you die, tonight, guess them per night: learn correct guesses.

*\[insert flavour\]*

### **The Counterfeiter fakes 2 players but tries to rectify their mistakes at the last moment in their lives.**
- The players who can't register correctly can register as any character but their own and as any alignment but their own.
- The Counterfeiter can guess their players even if they died during the day.
- The Counterfeiter chooses 2 players to guess per night.

### __How to run__
During setup, mark two players with the Counterfeiter’s **Fake** reminders.

Each time a player marked with the Counterfeiter's **Fake** reminder is targeted by an ability that detects or affects characters or players, choose which character and alignment the marked players register as (not their character or alignment). (Do whatever is appropriate, such as showing a character token, nodding, giving finger signals, or allowing an ability to work that would normally only affect players of other alignments or character.)

If the Counterfeiter dies, mark them **Regretting**.

During that night, wake the Counterfeiter, they point at 2 players per night (one at a time). For each that is marked **Fake** give a 'yes' hand signal and point to them. Put the Counterfeiter to sleep. 

# Minion

## Skinwalker

> You know a good player. Each night, choose a character & alignment you both register as to Townsfolk.

*They said I couldn't become like you. I will prove them wrong. I will become you.*

### **The Skinwalker takes the Apperance of someone else and shares it with another.**
- The Skinwalker can appear as any character on the script and as both good and evil.
- The Skinwalker makes both them and the other good player have to register as the chosen character and alignment.
- If the player the Skinwalker knows becomes evil, the Skinwalker learns another.

### __How to run__
While preparing the first night, put the **Shared Skin** reminder by any good character token. 

During the first night, wake the Skinwalker. Point to the player marked **Shared Skin**. Put the Skinwalker to sleep.

If the player marked with the Moonshiners **Shared Skin** reminder turns evil, remove the Skinwalker's **Shared Skin** reminder. Mark a good player with the Skinwalker’s **Shared Skin** reminder. Tonight, wake the Skinwalker. Point to the player marked **Shared Skin**. Put the Skinwalker to sleep.

Each night, wake the Skinwalker. The Skinwalker points to a character icon on their character sheet and either shake their head 'no' or nods their head 'yes'. Put the Skinwalker to sleep. Mark the character token that was pointed at with the Skinwalkers **Apperance** reminder. Mark the Skinwalker with the Skinwalker's **Evil** reminder if the Skinwalker shaked their head 'no' or with the **Good** reminder if they nodded their head 'yes'.

Each time the Skinwalker or player marked **Shared Skin** is targeted by a Townsfolk ability that detects or affects characters or alignments, the Skinwalker or player marked **Shared Skin** register as the character marked **Apperance** and as good if the Skinwalker is marked with the **Good** reminder and as evil if the Skinwalker is marked with the **Evil** reminder. (Do whatever is appropriate, such as showing a good character token, nodding, giving finger signals, or allowing an ability to work that would normally only affect good, Townsfolk, or Outsider players.)

## Gargoyle
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1179e016-7b99-423c-bdc5-6f4c2f1914b9" alt="gargoyle_evil" width="300" height="300">

> Each night, choose a player: players they nominate tomorrow might die tomorrow.

*Nothing misses my watch.*

### **The Gargoyle finds someone to follow, and kills their prey.**
- The player nominated by the player chosen by the Gargoyle can die at any time during that day, not only when the nomination happens.
- The Gargoyle can choose an evil player so they can direct the kill.
- As a storyteller you can be inclined to make any kills the Gargoyle can do, generally it is more helpful to only kill if the kill will help the evil team.

### __How to run__
Each night, wake the Gargoyle. They point at any player. Put the Gargoyle to sleep. Mark the chosen player with the **Watched** reminder. 

The next day, if the player marked **Watched** makes a nomination, mark the nominated player **Dying**. 

At any time during the day you may decide that the player marked **Dying** dies. Immediately declare that the player has died.

At dusk, remove the **Watched** reminder.

At dusk, remove the **Dying** reminder.

## Vessel
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f8ee180-878b-47e3-b7b9-885d36a27093" alt="vessel_evil" width="300" height="300">

> Evil players who nominate you swap characters with you. You can't die.

*You are now stuck with me. Keep me company. This is going to be so fun.*

### **The Vessel always houses someones soul but can swap which it holds.**
- The Vessel cannot die, not during the day, nor during the night.
- If the Vessel is nominated by an evil, swap the characters immediately but do not inform them until the night.
- Evil players can nominate good players to fake out the swap.

### __How to run__
If an evil player nominates the Vessel, mark both with the Vessels **Moved** reminder. Swap the character tokens of those players.

During that night, one at a time, wake each player with the **Moved** reminder, show them the 'You Are' info token and their new character token, then put them to sleep. Remove any **Moved** reminders.

If the Vessel would die, they remain alive. If the Vessel is executed, declare that this player is executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.)

## Wight


> If no Outsiders live, tongiht, choose 2 Townsfolk: they are poisoned. [-1 to +1 Outsider]

*You will not see the light of day.*

### **The Wight hunts down those who don't belong to awaken.**
- If the Wight chooses a player that isn't a Townsfolk, they choose again until 2 Townsfolk have been chosen.
- If there are no Outsiders in play, the Wight wakes on the first night.
- The Wight can add or remove 1 Outsider, but doesn't have to.

### __How to run__
While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag, you may add or remove one Outsider character token. 
- If you removed one, add a Townsfolk character token.
- If you added one, remove a Townsfolk character token.

If the last alive Outsider dies, mark the Wight with their **Awoken** reminder. 

During that night, wake the Wight. They point at 2 Townsfolk players, (if they choose any players that are not Townsfolk, ask them to choose again.) Mark those 2 players poisoned with the Wights **Poisoned** reminders.
