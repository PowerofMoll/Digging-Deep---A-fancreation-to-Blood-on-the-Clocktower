Mining timing is a script focused around deaths and survivals during the day and an important contemplation of wether you want to die or not. It was created during Clocktober of 2024 by Moll (@mollofpower) and Indigo (@indigocha0s).

# Lapidary
- You start knowing a character type & some that neighbour it clockwise or anticlockwise.

*such a beutiful gem you are*

**The Lapidary inspects some of what is around the mine.**
- The Lapidary can learn any number of character types in a row.
- It is reccomended to give between half and a third of the grimoire. Generally 3 or more for a better experience.
- Show the types by showing numbers using your hand, 1 representing Townsfolk, 2 representing Outsider, 3 representing Minion and 4 representing Demon.
