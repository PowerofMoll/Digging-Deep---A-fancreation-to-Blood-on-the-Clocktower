Digging Down is a script focused around deaths and survivals during the day and an important contemplation of wether you want to die or not. It was created during Clocktober of 2024 by Moll (@mollofpower) and Indigo (@indigocha0s).

## Wight

> If no Outsiders live, tongiht, choose 2 Townsfolk: they are poisoned. [-1 to +1 Outsider]

*You will not see the light of day.*

### **The Wight hunts down those who don't belong to awaken.**
- If the Wight chooses a player that isn't a Townsfolk, they choose again until 2 Townsfolk have been chosen.
- If there are no Outsiders in play, the Wight wakes on the first night.
- The Wight can add or remove 1 Outsider, but doesn't have to.

### How to run
While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag, you may add or remove one Outsider character token. 
- If you removed one, add a Townsfolk character token.
- If you added one, remove a Townsfolk character token.

If the last alive Outsider dies, mark the Wight with their **Awoken** reminder. 

During that night, wake the Wight. They point at 2 Townsfolk players, (if they choose any players that are not Townsfolk, ask them to choose again.) Mark those 2 players poisoned with the Wights **Poisoned** reminders.

# Demon

## Aurora

> Each night, you learn 3 players & their characters. Each night*, choose a player: they die.

*The northern light shines brightly over the mountain. It watches over us.*

### The Aurora's light shines brightly revealing those whose life the Aurora can claim.
- The Aurora learns a character and which player is it.
- The Aurora can't kill on the first night but still learns characters.

### How to run
Each night, wake the Aurora. Point at a player and show their character, 3 times. If it is the first night put the Aurora to sleep.

Each night except the first, the Aurora point at a player. That player dies - mark them with the **Dead** reminder. Put the Aurora to sleep.

## Wurm
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35cbedc4-b0e0-4e4b-92da-58c81f743ecf" alt="wurm_evil" width="300" height="300">

> Each night*, choose a player: they die. Your alive neighbours might die at any time.

*These terrifying creatures burrow beneath the ground, listening for the sounds of footsteps above. The only mercy offered by these creatures is the tell-tale hiss of their approach, thus allowing would-be victims a moment to prepare for the oncoming attack.*

### The Wurms powerful body can smash and kill anyone.
- As a storyteller generally only kill one of the Wurms neighbours if there is another reason to explain it.
- The Wurm should be used fairly, ending the game or making it unwinnable for the good team to win.
- The Wurm can kill any alive neighbour, skipping any dead neighbours.

### How to run
Each night except the first, wake the Wurm. They point at any player. That player dies - mark them with the **Dead** reminder. Put the Wurm to sleep.

At any time, you may decide that one of the Wurms alive neighbours die. If this is during the day, immediately declare that that player has died. If this is during the night, mark them with the **Dead** reminder and wait until dawn to declare which players died during the night. (Do not say how.)

## Rakshasa

> Each night*, choose a player: they die. You can't die to executions by Townsfolk, except if 3 players live. [+1 Outsider]

*You don't stand a chance against me.*

### The Rakshasa is immune to normal weapons.
- If a Townsfolk nominates the Rakshasa, they can't die by execution that day.
- The Rakshasa adds an Outsider so the good team still has a chance to win before final day.

### How to run
Each night except the first, wake the Rakshasa. They point at any player. That player dies - mark them with the **Dead** reminder. Put the Rakshasa to sleep.

If a Townsfolk nominates the Rakshasa, mark the Rakshasa with **Mundane Weapons**.

If the Rakshasa is executed while marked with **Mundane Weapons**, declare that this player is executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.)

At dusk, remove the **Mundane Weapons** reminder.

## Palingenesi
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cceb3386-1e9b-4032-99d1-d8627dbf62e3" alt="palingenesi_evil" width="300" height="300">

> Each night*, choose a player: they die. 1 alive player knows you are in play. If you die, they become an evil Palingenesi.

*Entry 5712: The Palingenesi in an entity found in 1662 in a cave, named after its ability to reform upon destruction. Burning, Crushing, Disolving, and Slashing are just a few methods we have tested, none have worked. We are trying all we can. It won't be contained. I will probably die before the end of the month. My death will hopefully contain it for enough time for a way to destroy it to be found. Someone had to be the sacrifice.*

### The Palingenesi reforms upon its death.
- If the player who knows the Palingenesi dies, an alive player learns it that night.
- As a storyteller you have an important decition to make as for whether you make an evil player learn it is in-play. Allowing it to turn more than 2 players is highly advice against. 
- If the game enters a situation were the good team is unable to win, end the game there and allow the player who knows the Palingenesi to win with evil.

### How to run
On the Palingenesi's first night, wake any player. Show them the Palingenesi character token. Put that player to sleep.

Each night except the first, wake the Palingenesi. They point at any player. That player dies - mark them with the **Dead** reminder. Put the Palingenesi to sleep.

If the Palingenesi dies, the player marked **Know** turns evil and becomes the Palingenesi. (The new Palingenesi now repeats the first paragraph)

If the player who knows the Palingenesi is in play dies while the Palingensi is alive, remove **Know** reminder, wake a new player and show them the Palingensi character token, mark them with the **Know** reminder.
