Mining timing is a script focused around deaths and survivals during the day and an important contemplation of wether you want to die or not. It was created during Clocktober of 2024 by Moll (@mollofpower) and Indigo (@indigocha0s).

- You start knowing a character type & some that neighbour it clockwise or anticlockwise.

*such a beutiful gem you are*

**The Lapidary inspects some of what is around the mine.**
- The Lapidary can learn any number of character types in a row.
- It is reccomended to give between half and a third of the grimoire. Generally 3 or more for a better experience.
- Show the types by showing numbers using your hand, 1 representing Townsfolk, 2 representing Outsider, 3 representing Minion and 4 representing Demon.


# Conservationist

- Once per game, if a player would die, they don`t & another might die instead.

*Leave us alone, don't break this down. Our home is on the line.*

**The Conservationist tries to make sure the mining operation stops.**
- The Conservationist can prevent a player from dying at any time, day or night.
- When a death is prevented, the storyteller can choose another to die but doesn't have to.
- We reccomend using the ability during the earlier days, using it later can feel unfair as the players had little power to prevent it. 

### __How to run__

At any time a player dies, you may decide that they don't. Do not declare that this happened. If you do, mark the Conservationist with the **No Ability** reminder. You may also decide that another player dies instead. If this is during the day, immediately declare that the other player has died. If this is during the night, remove the **Dead** reminder that was placed on the protected player and if you chose that another dies, mark them with that **Dead** reminder. Wait until dawn to declare which players died during the night. (Do not say how.)
