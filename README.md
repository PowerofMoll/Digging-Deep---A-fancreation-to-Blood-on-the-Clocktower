Mining timing is a script focused around deaths and survivals during the day and an important contemplation of wether you want to die or not. It was created during Clocktober of 2024 by Moll (@mollofpower) and Indigo (@indigocha0s).

# Lapidary
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5202bdda-d57f-45b3-9767-44358f033500" alt="lapidary_good" width="300" height="300">

> You start knowing a character type & some that neighbour it clockwise or anticlockwise.

*such a beutiful gem you are*

**The Lapidary inspects some of what is around the mine.**
- The Lapidary can learn any number of character types in a row.
- It is reccomended to give between half and a third of the grimoire. Generally 3 or more for a better experience.
- Show the types by showing numbers using your hand, 1 representing Townsfolk, 2 representing Outsider, 3 representing Minion and 4 representing Demon.


# Conservationist
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a38f8a5-8d94-4f24-81aa-9a55a937c946" alt="conservationist_good" width="300" height="300">

> Once per game, if a player would die, they don't & another might die instead.

*Leave us alone, don't break this down. Our home is on the line.*

### **The Conservationist tries to make sure the mining operation stops.**
- The Conservationist can prevent a player from dying at any time, day or night.
- When a death is prevented, the storyteller can choose another to die but doesn't have to.
- We reccomend using the ability during the earlier days, using it later can feel unfair as the players had little power to prevent it. 

### __How to run__

At any time a player dies, you may decide that they don't. Do not declare that this happened. If you do, mark the Conservationist with the **No Ability** reminder. You may also decide that another player dies instead. If this is during the day, immediately declare that the other player has died. If this is during the night, remove the **Dead** reminder that was placed on the protected player and if you chose that another dies, mark them with that **Dead** reminder. Wait until dawn to declare which players died during the night. (Do not say how.)


# Moonshiner
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/772aba6f-9074-497a-b405-a367736c5181" alt="moonshiner_good" width="300" height="300">

> 1 of the Demons alive good neighbours is drunk.

*Come take a sip, homemade to heighten our spirits.*

### **The Moonshiner hands out drinks... Illegally.**
- The Moonshiner only makes 1 player drunk at a time.
- The 2 closest alive good neighbours of the Demon can be, skipping over dead or evil players.
- If the drunk player dies, only then does a new player become drunk.
- If the Moonshiner dies, the player is no longer drunk.

### __How to run__
While preparing the first night, mark one of the Demons good neighbours with the Moonshiner’s **Drunk** reminder. This player is drunk.

If the player marked with the Moonshiners **Drunk** reminder dies, turns evil or stops neighbouring the Demon, remove the Moonshiner's **Drunk** reminder. Mark one of the Demons good neighbours with the Moonshiner’s **Drunk** reminder.

If the Moonshiner dies, remove their **Drunk** reminder.


# Skinwalker


> You know a good player. Each night, choose a character & alignment you both register as to Townsfolk.

### __How to run__
While preparing the first night, put the **Shared Skin** reminder by any good character token. 

During the first night, wake the Skinwalker. Point to the player marked **Shared Skin**. Put the Skinwalker to sleep.

If the player marked with the Moonshiners **Shared Skin** reminder turns evil, remove the Skinwalker's **Shared Skin** reminder. Mark a good player with the Skinwalker’s **Shared Skin** reminder. Tonight, wake the Skinwalker. Point to the player marked **Shared Skin**. Put the Skinwalker to sleep.

Each night, wake the Skinwalker. The Skinwalker points to a character icon on their character sheet and either shake their head 'no' or nods their head 'yes'. Put the Skinwalker to sleep. Mark the character token that was pointed at with the Skinwalkers **Apperance** reminder. Mark the Skinwalker with the Skinwalker's **Evil** reminder if the Skinwalker shaked their head 'no' or with the **Good** reminder if they nodded their head 'yes'.

Each time the Skinwalker or player marked **Shared Skin** is targeted by a Townsfolk ability that detects or affects characters or alignments, the Skinwalker or player marked **Shared Skin** register as the character marked **Apperance** and as good if the Skinwalker is marked with the **Good** reminder and as evil if the Skinwalker is marked with the **Evil** reminder. (Do whatever is appropriate, such as showing a good character token, nodding, giving finger signals, or allowing an ability to work that would normally only affect good, Townsfolk, or Outsider players.)

# Gargoyle


> Each night, choose a player: players they nominate tomorrow might die tomorrow.

### __How to run__
Each night, wake the Gargoyle. They point at any player. Put the Gargoyle to sleep. Mark the chosen player with the **Watched** reminder. 

The next day, if the player marked **Watched** makes a nomination, mark the nominated player **Dying**. 

At any time during the day you may decide that the player marked **Dying** dies. Immediately declare that the player has died.

At dusk, remove the **Watched** reminder.

At dusk, remove the **Dying** reminder.

# Vessel


> Evil players who nominate you swap characters with you. You can't die.

### __How to run__
If an evil player nominates the Vessel, mark both with the Vessels **Moved** reminder. Swap the character tokens of those players.

During that night, one at a time, wake each player with the **Moved** reminder, show them the 'You Are' info token and their new character token, then put them to sleep. Remove any **Moved** reminders.

If the Vessel would die, they remain alive. If the Vessel is executed, declare that this player is executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.)

# Wight


> If no Outsiders live, tongiht, choose 2 Townsfolk: they are poisoned. [-1 to +1 Outsider]

### __How to run__
While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag, you may add or remove one Outsider character token. 
- If you removed one, add a Townsfolk character token.
- If you added one, remove a Townsfolk character token.

If the last alive Outsider dies, mark the Wight with their **Awoken** reminder. 

During that night, wake the Wight. They point at 2 Townsfolk players, (if they choose any players that are not Townsfolk, ask them to choose again.) Mark those 2 players poisoned with the Wights **Poisoned** reminders.
