> You cannot die by execution. The 1st Vessel may (once), choose a player to swap characters with.

*You are now stuck with me. Keep me company. This is going to be so fun.*

### **The Vessel always houses someones soul but can swap which it holds.**
- The Vessel cannot die by execution. They can however die at night and by abilities.
- The first Vessel can swap characters at any time, at night, or during the day. If they either publicly wish to swap or request it in a consult, it happens immediately, but the other player does not learn it until the start of the night.

### How to run
During the day, the Vessel may publicly claim to be the Vessel and point to a player. Swap their characters with the Vessels. Tonight, wake them and show them **You Are** and their new character. Place the Vessels **Once** reminder in the middle of the grimoire.

During the day, the Vessel may request a private consult and point to a player. Swap their characters with the Vessels. Tonight, wake them and show them **You Are** and their new character. Place the Vessels **Once** reminder in the middle of the grimoire.

Each night, wake the Vessel. The Vessel either shakes their head 'no' or points at a player. Put the Vessel to sleep. If they pointed at a player swap the Vessels and their character tokens. Wake them and show **You are** and their new character token. If they pointed at a player put the Vessels **Once** reminder in the middle of the grimoire.

If the Vessels **Once** reminder is in the middle of the grimoire, don't wake any Vessel again due to their ability & they cannot not choose to swap characters.

If the Vessel would die, they remain alive. If the Vessel is executed, declare that this player is executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.)
