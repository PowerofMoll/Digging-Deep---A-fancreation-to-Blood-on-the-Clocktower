> Evil players (not Travellers) who nominate you swap characters with you, unless 3 players live. You can't die.

*You are now stuck with me. Keep me company. This is going to be so fun.*

### **The Vessel always houses someones soul but can swap which it holds.**
- The Vessel cannot die, not during the day, nor during the night.
- If the Vessel is nominated by an evil, swap the characters immediately but do not inform them until the night.
- Evil players can nominate good players to fake out the swap.

### How to run
If an evil player nominates the Vessel, mark both with the Vessels **Moved** reminder. Swap the character tokens of those players.

During that night, one at a time, wake each player with the **Moved** reminder, show them the 'You Are' info token and their new character token, then put them to sleep. Remove any **Moved** reminders.

If the Vessel would die, they remain alive. If the Vessel is executed, declare that this player is executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.)
