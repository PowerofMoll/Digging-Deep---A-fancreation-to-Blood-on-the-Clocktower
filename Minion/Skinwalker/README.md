> You know a good player. Each night, choose a character & alignment you both register as to Townsfolk until you choose again.

*They said I couldn't become like you. I will prove them wrong. I will become you.*

### **The Skinwalker takes the Apperance of someone else and shares it with another.**
- The Skinwalker can appear as any character on the script and as both good and evil.
- The Skinwalker makes both them and the other good player have to register as the chosen character and alignment.
- If the player the Skinwalker knows becomes evil, the Skinwalker learns another.

### How to run
While preparing the first night, put the **Shared Skin** reminder by any good character token. 

During the first night, wake the Skinwalker. Point to the player marked **Shared Skin**. Put the Skinwalker to sleep.

If the player marked with the Moonshiners **Shared Skin** reminder turns evil, remove the Skinwalker's **Shared Skin** reminder. Mark a good player with the Skinwalkerâ€™s **Shared Skin** reminder. Tonight, wake the Skinwalker. Point to the player marked **Shared Skin**. Put the Skinwalker to sleep.

Each night, wake the Skinwalker. The Skinwalker points to a character icon on their character sheet and either shake their head 'no' or nods their head 'yes'. Put the Skinwalker to sleep. Mark the character token that was pointed at with the Skinwalkers **Apperance** reminder. Mark the Skinwalker with the Skinwalker's **Evil** reminder if the Skinwalker shaked their head 'no' or with the **Good** reminder if they nodded their head 'yes'.

Each time the Skinwalker or player marked **Shared Skin** is targeted by a Townsfolk ability that detects or affects characters or alignments, the Skinwalker or player marked **Shared Skin** register as the character marked **Apperance** and as good if the Skinwalker is marked with the **Good** reminder and as evil if the Skinwalker is marked with the **Evil** reminder. (Do whatever is appropriate, such as showing a good character token, nodding, giving finger signals, or allowing an ability to work that would normally only affect good, Townsfolk, or Outsider players.)

### Examples
> The Skinwalker chooses the Metallurgist and good. That night the Technician chooses the Chorus and the Skinwalker, they learn 1 because the Skinwalker registers as a Townsfolk.

> The Skinwalker learns the Panner & chooses the Wurm and evil. The Storeman chooses the Panner and learns Moonshiner, as they are poisoned due to the Panner registering as evil.
