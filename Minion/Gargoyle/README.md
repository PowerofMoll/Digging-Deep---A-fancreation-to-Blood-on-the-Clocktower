> Each night, choose a player: players & characters of their alignment they learn, choose or nominate until dusk might die before dusk.

*Nothing misses my watch.*

### **The Gargoyle finds someone to follow, and kills their prey.**
- Players chosen at night by the player the Gargoyle chose can die at any time during that night & day, not only when the nomination happens.
- Players during the day by the player the Gargoyle chose can die at any time during that day, not only when the nomination happens.
- The player nominated by the player chosen by the Gargoyle can die at any time during that day, not only when the nomination happens.
- The Gargoyle can only kill players of the same alignment as the last chosen player.
- If a chosen player learns false information, the learned character or player might die, not the player or character they should have learned.
- As a storyteller you can be inclined to make any kills the Gargoyle can do, generally it is more helpful to only kill if the kill will help the evil team. I would also reccomend only killing one player per choice from the Gargoyle as most won't find it fun when 4 players die.

### How to run
Each night, wake the Gargoyle. They point at any player. Put the Gargoyle to sleep. Mark the chosen player with the **Watched** reminder. 

If a player marked **Watched** chooses a player of their alignment, you may mark the chosen player **Dying**.

The next day, if the player marked **Watched** makes a nomination and the nominee is a player of their alignment, you may mark the nominated player **Dying**. 

At any time you may decide that the player marked **Dying** dies. If this is during the day, immediately declare that the player has died. If this is during the night, mark them with the **Dead** reminder.

At dusk, remove the **Watched** reminder.

At dawn, remove any **Dying** reminder.

### Examples
> The Gargoyle chooses the Gargoyle. That day the Gargoyle nominates the Counterfeiter, the Counterfeiter doesn't die as the Counterfeiter is not evil.

> The Gargoyle chooses the Lapidary. That day the Lapidary does not nominate. The next day the Lapidary nominates the Moonshiner, who doesnâ€™t die.

> On the 1st day the Conservationist nominates the Surveyor, who is executed but does not die due to the Conservationists ability. That night the Gargoyle chooses the Metallurgist, that night they learn Surveyor, the Surveyor dies as the Metallurgist was chosen by the Gargoyle.
