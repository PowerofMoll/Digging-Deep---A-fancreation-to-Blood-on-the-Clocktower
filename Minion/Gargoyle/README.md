> Each night, choose a player: players they choose tonight or nominate tomorrow might die before dusk.

*Nothing misses my watch.*

### **The Gargoyle finds someone to follow, and kills their prey.**
- The player nominated by the player chosen by the Gargoyle can die at any time during that day and the next night, not only when the nomination happens.
- The Gargoyle can choose an evil player so they can direct the kill.
- As a storyteller you can be inclined to make any kills the Gargoyle can do, generally it is more helpful to only kill if the kill will help the evil team.

### How to run
Each night, wake the Gargoyle. They point at any player. Put the Gargoyle to sleep. Mark the chosen player with the **Watched** reminder. 

The next day, if the player marked **Watched** makes a nomination, mark the nominated player **Dying**. 

At any time you may decide that the player marked **Dying** dies. If this is during the day, immediately declare that the player has died. If this is during the night, mark them with the **Dead** reminder.

At dusk, remove the **Watched** reminder.

At dawn, remove the **Dying** reminder.

### Examples
> The Gargoyle chooses the Gargoyle. That day the Gargoyle nominates the Counterfeiter, that dusk the Counterfeiter dies.

> The Gargoyle chooses the Lapidary. That day the Lapidary does not nominate. The next day the Lapidary nominates the Moonshiner, who doesnâ€™t die.

> The Surveyor neighbours the Metallurgist. The Gargoyle chooses the Surveyor. That day the Surveyor nominates the Metallurgist, The Overman dies that night as the Surveyor is making another player than their neighbour die.
