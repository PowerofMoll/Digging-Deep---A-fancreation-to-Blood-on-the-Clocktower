> You start knowing the in-play Characters. The 1st night no Outsiders live, choose a character: they are poisoned. [-1 to +1 Outsider]

*You will not see the light of day.*

### **The Wraith hunts down those who don't belong to awaken.**
- When there are no Outsiders alive, the Wraith wakes and chooses a character to be poisoned.
- If there are no Outsiders in play, the Wraith wakes on the first night.
- The Wraith can add or remove 1 Outsider, but doesn't have to.
- The Wraith knows every in-play character.
- If the Wraith forgets which characters they saw on the first night, answer them honestly if they ask you.

### How to run
While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag, you may add or remove one Outsider character token. 
- If you removed one, add a Townsfolk character token.
- If you added one, remove a Townsfolk character token.

On the first night, wake the Wraith and show them each in-play character.

If the last alive Outsider dies, mark the Wraith with their **Awoken** reminder. 

During that night, wake the Wraith. They point at a Character. Mark that player poisoned with the Wraith **Poisoned** reminder. Remove the **Awoken** reminder.
