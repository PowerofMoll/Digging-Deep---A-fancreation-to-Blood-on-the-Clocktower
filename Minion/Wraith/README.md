## Wraith

> If no Outsiders live, tongiht, choose 2 Townsfolk: they are poisoned. [-1 to +1 Outsider]

*You will not see the light of day.*

### **The Wraith hunts down those who don't belong to awaken.**
- If the Wight chooses a player that isn't a Townsfolk, they choose again until 2 Townsfolk have been chosen.
- If there are no Outsiders in play, the Wight wakes on the first night.
- The Wight can add or remove 1 Outsider, but doesn't have to.

### How to run
While setting up the game, before putting character tokens in the bag, you may add or remove one Outsider character token. 
- If you removed one, add a Townsfolk character token.
- If you added one, remove a Townsfolk character token.

If the last alive Outsider dies, mark the Wraith with their **Awoken** reminder. 

During that night, wake the Wraith. They point at 2 Townsfolk players, (if they choose any players that are not Townsfolk, ask them to choose again.) Mark those 2 players poisoned with the Wraith **Poisoned** reminders.
