## Adversary

> You and the other Adversary have the same ability. On your 1st day, you learn a part of it. [2 opposing Adversaries]

### The Adversary has one of their own, but they hold a key to understanding themselves.
- The Adversaries both have the same ability, this can be any ability, one in clocktower, from a homebrew, or completely original. The Adversary knows a part of their ability, the other Adversary knows a part as well, these don't neccecarily have to be different, but you are recommended to.
- The Adversary can only enter play as 2, if only 1 player wants to travel, they cannot travel as the Adversary.

### How to run
During the first night after the Adversary enters play, decide what ability the Adversary players have. During the game, treat that player as if they had that ability, waking them when needed, prompting them to choose players when needed, or whatever else is appropriate. Use the Adversary's ? reminders if you need to.

Each day, the Amnesiac makes a guess about their ability in private. Answer “Cold”, “Warm”, “Hot, or “Bingo”.
