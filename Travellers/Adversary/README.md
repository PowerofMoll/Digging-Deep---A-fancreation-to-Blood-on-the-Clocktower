> You and the other Adversary have the same ability. On your 1st day, you learn a part of it. If one dies, the other does too. [2 opposing Adversaries]

*Is that another challenger? Finally. It's been ages since I've had a good fight.*

### The Adversary has one of their own, but they hold a key to understanding themselves.
- The Adversaries both have the same ability, this can be any ability, one in clocktower, from a homebrew, or completely original. The Adversary knows a part of their ability, the other Adversary knows a part as well, these don't neccecarily have to be different, but you are recommended to.
- The Adversary can only enter play as 2, if only 1 player wants to travel, they cannot travel as the Adversary.
- The Adversaries can learn any part of their ability, not neccecarily the start or the end, you can also give them differently big parts. We recommend storytellers to give both Adversaries important pieces of the ability, to make both feel like they have a chance of solving the ability.
- While the Adversaries can have any ability, we recommend you give an ability they can figure out to some reason of doubt and also making sure it feels fair on the full players in the game.

### How to run
During the first night after the Adversary enters play, decide what ability the Adversary players have. During the game, treat that player as if they had that ability, waking them when needed, prompting them to choose players when needed, or whatever else is appropriate. Use the Adversary's ? reminders if you need to.

During the first day, for each Adversary, if they requests a private chat with you, take them away from the circle so you cannot be overheard. Whisper some part of their ability, the words you learn don't have to start from the begining or the last words, but can be. (If you cannot haven't decided on some right away, either take your time or ask them to come back in a few minutes.)
