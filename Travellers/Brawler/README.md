> You may nominate any number of times & players who have already been nominated. Players you nominate might be drunk until dawn.

*Crush your drink and grab a chair, itâ€™s time for a bar fight!*

### The Brawler may accuse any players, no matter what has happened during the day
- The Brawler may nominate player who have already been nominated or if the Brawler has already nominated.
- If the Brawler nominates a player, the storyteller may choose for them to be poisoned until dawn.
- We reccomend for the Brawler to poison most players they nominate, keeping the Demon or Outsiders healthy. Try to make sure the poisons are a bit more helpful to the Brawlers team than not. The Brawler is not intended to be able to nominate Outsiders to make them poisoned.
- If the Brawler is repeatedly nominating the same player multiple times, or nominating when its unlikely to be lifted as a way to waste time, the storyteller may choose that their nomination does not count. This should never be done for any reason but the Brawler wasting time for little reason.

### How to run
If the Brawler already has nominated, they may nominate again.

When the Brawler nominates, they may nominate a player who has already been nominated.

If the Golem nominates player, you may mark that player **Poisoned**.

At dawn, remove any **Poisoned** reminders.
