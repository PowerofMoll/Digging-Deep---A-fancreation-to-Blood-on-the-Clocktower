> Players may make deals with you. If a party who hasn't broken it catches the other breaking it, the breaker dies.

*I welcome you my friend. My friend death.*

### The Debt Collector punishes those who don't keep their promises to them.
- Players may make a promise to the Debt Collector either publicly or privately, for them to be eligeble, the Debt Collector, storyteller and player making the promise must be present and agree.
- If the Debt Collector has found that they other party has broken the deal, they have to know, just suspecting isn't enough, they may state as such to the storyteller, either publicly or privately. That player dies immediately.
- If a player who has made a deal has found that they Debt Collector has broken the deal, they have to know, just suspecting isn't enough, they may state as such to the storyteller, either publicly or privately. The Debt Collector dies immediately.
- A deal cannot be removed by anything less than the Debt Collectors death.
- Deals have to be able to be judged as broken or not by the players.
- Make sure promises aren't unclear, the game ends up being a lot less fun if you have to argue on the pedantics of a promise.
- If players are trying to pressure the Debt Collector to publicly declare having caught a deal, the Storyteller may choose to not count it, if so, tell them this at the earliest opportunity.
- If players are trying to pressure the Debt Collector into making a deal, the storyteller may declare that the Debt Collector cannot be a part of any deals, if so, tell them and the other player at the earliest opportunity.
- If players are trying to pressure a player into breaking a deal, the Storyteller may choose not to count it as broken, if so, tell them and the Debt Collector at the earliest opportunity.

### How to run
During each day, players may together with the Debt Collector request a private chat with you, take them away from the circle so you cannot be overheard. The player makes a deal. (You may want to note it down.) Mark the player who made the promise with **Debt**. 

The Debt Collector, if they see a player marked **Debt** break the deal they made with the Debt Collector, may either:
- publicly declare that the player did, if so, that player dies, immediately declare that the player has died.
- request a private chat with you, take them away from the circle so you cannot be overheard. The Debt Collector may then then tell you the player did, if so, that player dies. When you return to the circle, immediately declare that the player has died.

A played marked **Debt**, if they see the **Debt Collector** break the deal they made, may either:
- publicly declare that the player did, if so, the Debt Collector dies, immediately declare that the Debt Collector has died.
- request a private chat with you, take them away from the circle so you cannot be overheard. The player marked **Debt** may then then tell you the player did, if so, the Debt Collector dies. When you return to the circle, immediately declare that the Debt Collector has died.
