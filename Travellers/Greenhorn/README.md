### The Greenhorn has just moved in and have just gotten a job.
- The Greenhorn gains the ability of any Townsfolk, in-play or not.
- The Greenhorn has acts as if they have that ability for all purposes.
- If the Greenhorn has an in-play ability that would wake. Wake them after the in-play Townsfolk has woken and gone to sleep.

### How to run
During the first night after the Greenhorn enters play, wake the Greenhorn. Show them the **You Are** info token, then a Townsfolk token. In the Grimoire on the Townsfolk token (if not-in-play place the token in the grimoire), and mark them with **Job** reminder. That player remains the Apprentice but gains the ability of their character token.
