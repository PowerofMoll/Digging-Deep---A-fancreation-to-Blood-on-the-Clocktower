## Appraiser

> Each day, you may publicly choose 2 players: today, they may only vote if both agree & can`t vote for each other.

### The Appraiser makes 2 people work together.
- The Appraiser may choose 2 people each day, for that day, those people may not vote on eachother, nor vote if the other disagrees.
- The chosen players can mark agreement my raising a hand as if intending to vote, saying "I agree with this vote" or something similar, showing a yes side of a paper or if the chosen players can agree on another system to clearly show it, that can also be used.
- If the players aren't agreeing they may not vote nor may they vote on eachother.

### How to run


If the Butler accidentally votes illegally, tally the Butler's vote anyway. If you don't, the total will be less than it should be, and all players will know which player is the Butler, which is unfair for the evil team. Mistakes happen. Just play on and have a private chat later.
