> Each day, you may publicly choose another player: today, you & they may only vote if the other agrees.

*You two look like you would pair perfectly together.*

### The Appraiser forces two to work as one.
- The Appraiser may choose 1 player each day, for that day, the Appraiser and the chosen player may only vote if the other agrees.
- The Appraiser & the chosen player can mark agreement my raising a hand as if intending to vote, saying "I agree with this vote" or something similar, showing a yes side of a paper or if the chosen players can agree on another system to clearly show it, that can also be used.
- If they aren't agreeing they may not vote.
- If the Appraiser is pressured to make a specific choice, the storyteller may say it doesn't count so the Appraiser can make the choice they want to make.
- The Appraiser and chosen player do not need to agree to vote on an exile.

### How to run
Each day, once only, if the Appraiser declares that they wish to use their ability, prompt them to choose a player. Mark them **Linked**.

During a nomination, the player marked **Linked** & the Appraiser may only have their hand raised to vote when the Storyteller is counting their vote if the other player has expressed agreement in allowing the vote.

It is up to the storyteller to decide what counts as agreement, but the players need to know before the nomination is ran. If a disagreement happens on it, the storyteller decides how the vote will have been counted.

If a player marked **linked** or the Appraiser accidentally votes illegally. You may choose to not tally the vote, and tell them after the nomination.
