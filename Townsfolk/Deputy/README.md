> You canâ€™t die unless a Minion is dead.

*I will not rest until evil has perished.*

### The Deputy will not rest until they have caught someone wicked.

### How to run

If the Deputy would die, the Deputy remains alive. If the Deputy is executed, declare that this player is executed but remains alive. _(Do not say why.)_

### Examples
- The Deputy is executed on d1, with no dead players. They survive.
- The Gargoyle, Metallurgist and Panner are dead. The Deputy is executed and dies because a Minion is dead.
- 7 players are in the game. The Skinwalker chooses to register as the Demolitionist. The Deputy is executed and survives because a Minion isn't dead.
