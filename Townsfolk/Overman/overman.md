> If you die, tonight, learn a good player per night.

*There is nothing going on with the mine. I am the owner, don't you dare go against my judgement.*

### The Overman finds who to trust when they realise problems are really happening.
- The Overman wakes to learn information if they die, during the day or night.
- The Overman learns an equal number of good players to the night number, even if they were created later in the game.

### How to run
If the Overman dies, mark them **Crumbling**.

During that night, wake the Overman, point at a good player per night. Put the Overman to sleep.
