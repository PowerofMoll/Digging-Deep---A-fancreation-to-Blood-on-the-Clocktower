> Each night*, if the dead equal or outnumber the living, you learn an evil player.

*There is nothing going on with the mine. I will only take action if i see real proof.*

### The Overman hunts down the dangers lurking when they have seen their destruction.
- The Overman only wakes to learn information if there are as many or more dead players than alive. 
- The Overman learns an evil player each night. If it is a big game we reccomend avoiding showing the Demon immediately.

### How to run
When the number of dead players equals or exceeds the number of alive players, add a night token to the Overmanâ€™s entry on the night sheet. Each night, if the Overman has a night token on the night sheet, wake the Overman. Point to an evil player. Put the Overman to sleep.

### Examples
> It is night 4, 5 players live, 5 are dead. The Overman learns the Vurm.
