> Each night*, if one of your alive neighbours died since dawn, you learn an evil player.

*There is nothing going on with the mine. I will only take action if i see real proof.*

### The Overman hunts down the dangers lurking when they have seen the destuction they cause.
- If one of the Overmans neighbours die, the Overman wakes that night. They only wake once, even if multiple neighbours died.
- When the Overman wakes they learn an evil player.
- If the Overman is dead when they would wake, they don't.

### How to run
If one of the Overman's alive neighbours die & the Overman is not marked with the **Dead Comrade** reminder, mark the Overman with the **Dead Conrade** reminder.

Each night except the first, if the Overman is marked **Dead Comrade**, wake the Overman. Point at an evil player. Put the Overman to sleep.

At Dawn remove the **Dead Comrade** reminder if it is there.

### Examples
> The Overman is sat next to the Moonshiner. On the 1st day the Moonshiner is executed, that night the Overman learns the Wurm.
