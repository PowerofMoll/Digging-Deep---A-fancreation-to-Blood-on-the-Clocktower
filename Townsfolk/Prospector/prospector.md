> Each night*, you learn the character you nominated today. If an evil player died since dawn, this info is arbitrary.

*I've struck gold!!!*

### The Prospectors can learn the characters of players they nominate, unless an evil player recently died.
- The Prospector is shown the token of the player they nominated yesterday. If they didn't nominate, they don't wake.
- If an evil player died during the day or night, the Prospectors can be shown any character token.

### How to run
Each night except the first, if a player is marked **Gold**, wake the Prospector and show them the character token of the player marked **Gold**. Put the Prospector to sleep.

If the Prospector nominates a player, mark that player **Gold**.

If an evil player dies, mark the Prospector with their **Fools Gold** reminder.

At dawn remove the **Gold** reminder.

At dawn remove the **Fools Gold** reminder.
