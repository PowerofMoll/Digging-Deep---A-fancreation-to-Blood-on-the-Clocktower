## Metallurgist

> Each night*, you learn a character which would've died but didn't since dusk or that none did.

*Nothing passes by my watch, I know the system. It is like fibres building up my being. I am the one who can utelise it the best. Stand below my feet fellow workers.*

### The Operator sees the inner working of how the system is working.
- The Operator learns the characters of player whose death was prevented by an ability or due to being dead.
- If no characters death was prevented, the Operator learns a no.

### How to run
Each night except the first, wake the Operator, show the character token of a player marked **Prevented** or shake your head 'no' if there are none.

If a player would be marked dead, but wasn't (due to an ability or due to being dead.) mark them with one of the Operator's **Prevented** reminders.

At dawn remove any **Prevented** reminders.
