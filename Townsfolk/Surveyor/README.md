> If one of your alive neighbours would die, another player might die instead.

*Welcome to the new land. This is our place to deplete. Cash is soon come!*

### The Surveyor explores the new lands and makes sure their company doesn't run into trouble.
- When one of the Surveyors alive neighbours would die, the storyteller can instead choose another player to die.
- If an ability's death is redirected, the source of the death is still the one that tried to kill the Surveyors neighbour. *Not* the Surveyor.
- We reccomend the storyteller not do this always, imagine the Surveyor as having a power budget, saving one of the neighbours costs a bit, redirecting the kill onto someone the evil team doesn't want dead, costs more. The ability should not harm the good team, so by saving someone it should always be better than them having died.

### How to run
If one of the Surveyors alive neighbours would die, you may choose that another player dies instead. If this is during the day announce that the player that didn't die, didn't. (do not say why) If this is during the night, move the **Dead** reminder placed on the neighbour onto another player, that player dies. (Do not say why they die or that this happened.)
