## Spotter

> A good player can't die, if they would: their clockwise alive good neighbour can't die instead.

*You are not allowed to die under my watch!*

### The Spotter prevents good players from dying.
-  A good player can't die, the Spotter does not know who. If that player dies their clockwise player can't die instead, skipping dead and evil players.
-  If the good player who can't die becomes evil or dies (ex. while the spotter is drunk), the clockwise good player can't die instead.

### How to run
While preparing the first night, put the **Can't die** reminder by any good character token.

If the player marked **Can't Die** would die, they remain alive and remove the **Can't Die** reminder, place it next to the good character token of the alive player 1 step clockwise from the previous. If a player marked **Can't Die** is executed, declare that the marked player is executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.) Remove the **Can't Die** reminder, place it next to the good character token of the alive player 1 step clockwise from the previous.
