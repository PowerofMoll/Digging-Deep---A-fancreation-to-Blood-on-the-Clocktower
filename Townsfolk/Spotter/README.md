> An alive good player can't die. After they would have died, their clockwise alive good neighbour can't die instead.

*You are not allowed to die under my watch!*

### The Spotter prevents good players from dying.
-  A good player can't die, the Spotter does not know who. If that player dies their clockwise player can't die instead, skipping dead and evil players.
-  If the good player who can't die becomes evil or dies (ex. while the spotter is drunk), the clockwise good player can't die instead.

### How to run
While preparing the first night, put the **Can't die** reminder by any good character token.

If the player marked **Can't Die** would die, they remain alive and remove the **Can't Die** reminder, place it next to the good character token of the alive player 1 step clockwise from the previous. If a player marked **Can't Die** is executed, declare that the marked player is executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.) Remove the **Can't Die** reminder, place it next to the good character token of the alive player 1 step clockwise from the previous.

### Examples
> The Spotter neighbours the Driller clockwise. The Driller is executed but does not die due to being protected from the Spotter. That night the Spotter is chosen by the Demon and does not die due to being protected from the Spotter..

> The Gargoyle neighbours the Geologist clockwise. The Panner neighbours the Gargoyle clockwise. The Geologist is executed but does not die due to the Spotters ability. The next day the Panner is executed but does not die due to the Gargoyles ability.
