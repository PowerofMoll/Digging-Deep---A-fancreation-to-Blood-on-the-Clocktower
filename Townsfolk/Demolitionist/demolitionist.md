> Once per game, during the day, publicly choose 2 players: if 1 dies, the other does too.

*3! 2! 1! Boom!!!*

### The Demolitionist links 2 people together so if 1 dies the other blows up too.
- The Demolitionist clearly chooses 2 players to link. (it can be themselves)
- If 1 dies, the other does so immediately.
- If only 3 players live and a player chosen by the Demolitionist dies, the other player dies too, leaving only 1 player left alive.

### How to run
During the day, the Demolitionist can declare that they wish to use their ability. If so, the Demolitionist points at any 2 players. They are marked with the Demolitionists **Charge** reminder. The Demolitionist loses their ability â€” put the Demolitionist's **No Ability** reminder token by the Demolitionist token.

If a player marked **Charge** dies, the other does so too. If this is during the day. Immediately decare that the player has died. If this is during the night, mark them with the **Dead** reminder and wait until dawn to declare which players died during the night. (Do not say how.)
