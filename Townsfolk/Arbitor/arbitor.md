## Arbitor

> Each night, choose a player: their opposing neighbours can't die until dusk.

*Stop. You shall not fight. If one of you starts to even move in a direction or think the thought of fighting, you will face me.*

### The Arbitor makes sure those under their watch cannot fight with their neighbours.
- The Arbitor chooses a player each night.
- Their neighbours who are not on that players alignment cannot die until dusk.

### How to run
Each night, wake the Arbitor. They point at a player. Put the Arbitor to sleep. For each of their neighbours who are not on their alignment, mark them with **Protected**.

If a player marked **Protected** would die, they remain alive. If a player marked **Protected** is executed, declare that the marked player is executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.)

At dusk remove any **Protected** reminders.
