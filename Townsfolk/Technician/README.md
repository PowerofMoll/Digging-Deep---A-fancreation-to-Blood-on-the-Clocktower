> Each night, choose 3 players (not yourself): you learn if exactly 1 is evil.

*On the job sir!!*

### The Technician can pinpoint problematic areas.
- The Technician points at any 3 players of their choice, dead or alive, except for themselves.
- The Technician learns a yes only if exactly 1 is evil, if 0, 2 or 3 are, they learn a no.
- The Technician may choose the same players multiple nights in a row.

### How to run

Each night, wake the Technician. They point at 3 players. If exactly 1 is evil give the 'yes' head signal, otherwise give the 'no' head signal. Put the Technician to sleep.

### Examples
- The Technician chooses the Wurm, Gargoyle and Spotter and learns a no as 2 are evil.
- The Technician chooses the Panner, Lapidary and good Adversary and learns no, as none are evil.
