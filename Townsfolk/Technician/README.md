> Each night, choose 2 players: you learn the character type of 1 of them.

*On the job sir!!*

### The Technician can see how players interact with the system.
- The Technician chooses 2 players each night and learns 1, 2, 3 or 4.
- The number has to be of one of the players chosens character type. 1 = Townsfolk, 2 = Outsider, 3 = Minion and 4 = Demon. 

### How to run

Each night, wake the Technician. They point at 2 players. Give a finger signal 1, 2, 3 or 4 for 1 of their character types. 1 = Townsfolk, 2 = Outsider, 3 = Minion and 4 = Demon. Put the Technician to sleep.

### Examples

> The Technician chooses the Moonshiner and the Vessel and learns a 3, because one of them is a Minion.

> The Technician chooses the Prospector and the Adversary and learns a 5 because one of them is a Traveller and it would be unfair to confirm the other player as Townsfolk.

> The Technician chooses the Chorus and the Skinwalker who chose Metallurgist and good, they learn 1 because the Skinwalker registers as a Townsfolk.
