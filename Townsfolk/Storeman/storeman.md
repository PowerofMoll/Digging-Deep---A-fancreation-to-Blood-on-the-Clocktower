## Storeman

> Once per game, at night, choose a player: you learn & gain their ability. If they are evil, you are drunk.

*Take a look at what we've got.*

### The Storeman follows anothers lead in their task.
- The Storeman may choose another player once.
- They learn that players character and gain their ability.
- If the chosen player is evil, they are drunk and told any character and don't get an ability, but wake them as if they did.

### How to run
Each night, wake the Storeman. They either shake their head no or point at any player.

If they shake their head no, nothing happens. Put the Storeman to sleep.

If they point at a player, if that player is evil mark the Storeman as **Poisoned**. Show the chosen players character token (any if the Storeman is poisoned). Put the Storeman to sleep. Mark the learned character token with **Gained Ability**. Mark the Storeman with the **No Ability** reminder and remove their night token from the night sheet.
