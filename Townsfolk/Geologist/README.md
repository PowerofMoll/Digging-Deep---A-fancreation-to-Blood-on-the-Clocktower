> Each night, choose 2 players: you learn 1 of them that is good. If both are evil, this info is arbitrary

*This is an amazing earth, the minerals here will yeild well.*

### The Geologist can find out which of 2 players is more likely to be good.
- The Geologist chooses 2 players and learns one of them.
- If at least 1 registers as good, they must be shown.
- If both register as evil, either can be learned.

### How to run
Each night, wake the Geologist. They point at 2 players. Point at 1 of them that is good, or either is both are evil. Put the Geologist to sleep.

> The Geologist chooses the Panner and the Gargoyle, they learn the Panner because it is good.

> The Geologist chooses the Skinwalker who chose Gargoyle and good that night and the Lapidary. The Geologist learns the Skinwalker because they are registering as good.

> The Geologist chooses the Aurora and the Vessel. They learn the Aurora because both are evil.
