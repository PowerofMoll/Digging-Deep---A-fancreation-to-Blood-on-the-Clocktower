> Once per game, at night, choose up to 3 characters: you learn how many neighbour a Demon.

*Such beutiful gems. A little amethyst, small pieces of ruby, and one sizable emerald.*

### **The Lapidary inspects some of what is around the mine. And what light is reflected from around them.**
- The Lapidary choose 0, 1, 2 or 3 characters. The Characters can be both good and evil. They are shown a finger signal for the amound of them who neighbour a Demon. This counts neighbours, not neccecarily alive neighbours.
- The Lapidary may only use their ability once per game, and at night.
- This only count the number of chosen characters which neighbours a Demon, not how many of them do.

### How to run
Each night, wake the Lapidary. They either shake their head no or nod their head yes. 

If they shake their head no, nothing happens. Put the Lapidary to sleep.

If they nod their head yes, they point at 0, 1, 2 or 3 icons on their character sheet. Show the Lapidary fingers (0, 1, 2, 3) equal to the number of then which neighbour a Demon. Put the Lapidary to sleep. The Lapidary loses their ability - mark them with the **No Ability** reminder and remove their night token from the night sheet.

### Examples
> The Wurm sits next to the Driller and the Demolitionist. On the first night the Lapidary chooses Lapidary, Demolitionist and Roamer and learns a 1 as the Demolitionist is the only one neighbouring a Demon.
