> Once per game, visit the Storyteller & privately choose a character type, you learn some of their neighbours character types.

*Such beutiful gems. A little amethyst, small pieces of ruby, and one sizable emerald.*

### **The Lapidary inspects some of what is around the mine.**
- The Lapidary can learn any number of character types, we reccomend telling them more if they choose Townsfolk or Minion than if they choose Demon.
- The Lapidary can use their ability at any point during the day but is never forced to do so.

### How to run
Once per game, during the day, if the Lapidary requests a private chat with you, take them away from the circle so you cannot be overheard. The Lapidary may whispers a character type to you. If they do, tell them any number of character types (you may say the same one multiple times) that neighbour a player of the type they whispered to you, mark the Lapidary with their **No Ability** reminder. (If you cannot decide on some character types right away, either take your time or ask them to come back in a few minutes.)

### Examples
> The Wurm sits next to the Driller and the Demolitionist. On the first day the Lapidary chooses Demon and learns Townsfolk and Townsfolk.

> The Skinwalker neighbours the Roamer and the Technician. The Skinwalker knows the Roamer and chooses the Gargoyle and good. On the 1st day the Lapidary chooses Minion and learns Minion and Minion.

> The Metallurgist neighbours the Spotter and the Panner, the Panner neighbours the Storeman, the Storeman neighbours the Deputy. On the 1st day the Lapidary chooses Townsfolk and learns, Townsfolk, Townsfolk, Townsfolk, Townsfolk and Townsfolk.
