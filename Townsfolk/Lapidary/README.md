> On your 1st day, you may visit the Storyteller to privately learn the order of character types of some neighbouring players.

*Such beutiful gems. A little amethyst, small pieces of ruby, and one sizable emerald.*

### **The Lapidary inspects some of what is around the mine.**
- The Lapidary can learn any number of character types in a row.
- It is reccomended to give between half and a third of the grimoire. Generally 3 or more for a better experience.
- Learning about some character types is a lot stronger, if you show the Demon it is generally reccomended to show less other players.

### How to run
During the first day, if the Lapidary requests a private chat with you, take them away from the circle so you cannot be overheard. Whisper some character types one at a time that neighbour eachother. (If you cannot haven't decided on some right away, either take your time or ask them to come back in a few minutes.)

### Examples
> The Wurm sits next to the Driller and the Demolitionist. On the first day the Lapidary learns Townsfolk, Demon and Townsfolk.

> The Skinwalker neighbours the Roamer and the Technician. The Skinwalker knows the Roamer and chooses the Gargoyle and good. On the 1st day the Lapidary learns Townsfolk, Minion and Minion.

> The Metallurgist neighbours the Spotter and the Panner, the Panner neighbours the Storeman, the Storeman neighbours the Deputy. On the 1st day the Lapidary learns Townsfolk, Townsfolk, Townsfolk, Townsfolk and Townsfolk.
