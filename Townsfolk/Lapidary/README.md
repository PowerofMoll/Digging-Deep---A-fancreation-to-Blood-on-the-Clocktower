> On your 1st day, you may visit the Storyteller to privately learn the order of character types of some neighbouring players.

*Such beutiful gems. A little amethyst, small pieces of ruby, and one sizable emerald.*

### **The Lapidary inspects some of what is around the mine.**
- The Lapidary can learn any number of character types in a row.
- It is reccomended to give between half and a third of the grimoire. Generally 3 or more for a better experience.
- Learning about some character types is a lot stronger, if you show the Demon it is generally reccomended to show less other players.

### How to run
During the first day, if the Lapidary requests a private chat with you, take them away from the circle so you cannot be overheard. Whisper some character types one at a time that neighbour eachother. (If you cannot haven't decided on some right away, either take your time or ask them to come back in a few minutes.)
