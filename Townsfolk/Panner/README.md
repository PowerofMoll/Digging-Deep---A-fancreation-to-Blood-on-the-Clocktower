> Once per game, during the day, publicly choose up to 2 players: if all are good, the 1st time each dies, they don't.

*I got rid of the glittering boulder for this? It's so... so useless without a lucky lunch.* 

### The Panner sifts through sand and tries to find gold to share.
- The Panner publicly chooses either 1 or 2 players, give them some time if they need. If all of the chosen players are good, the next time they die, they live instead. This works once for each of them. If one or both are evil, nothing happens.
- The Panner can choose themselves. 
- The Panner can choose to use their ability only during the day if a majority of players and the storyteller hears, before or during nominations.

### How to run
During the day, the Panner can declare that they wish to use their ability. If so, the Panner point at any two playesr. If the chosen players are both good, mark them with the Panner's **Extra Life** reminder. Either way mark the Panner with the **No Ability** reminder.

If a player is bluffing as the Panner and declares they wish to use their ability, act as if they were indeed the Panner — allow time for discussion, let them make the decision, and act like you're fiddling with tokens in your Grimoire.

If a player marked **Extra Life** would die, they remain alive and you remove the **Extra Life** reminder. If a player marked **Extra Life** is executed, declare that the marked player is executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.) Remove the **Extra Life** reminder.

If the Panner dies, remove the **Extra Life** reminders.

### Examples
> The Panner chooses the Deputy and the Wraith. The next day the Deputy is executed and dies as the Panner didn’t choose 2 good players.

> The Panner is 'about to die' and claims to be the Panner choosing only themselves. When they are executed, they live.
