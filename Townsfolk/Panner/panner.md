## Panner

> When you learn that you died, publicly choose 2 players: if both are good, the 1st time each dies, they don't.

*I got rid of the glittering boulder for this? It's so... so useless without a lucky lunch.* 

### The Panner sifts through sand possibly finding gold before their death.
- The Panner publicly chooses 2 players when they die.
- If both are good, they live the 1st time they would die. This works once each for them.
- If one or both are evil, nothing happens.

### How to run
When the Panner player is declared dead, they must declare that they are the Panner and then point at two players. (Give them time.) If both are good mark them **Extra Life**.

If a player marked **Extra Life** would die, they remain alive and you remove the **Extra Life** reminder. If a player marked **Extra Life** is executed, declare that the marked player is executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.) Remove the **Extra Life** reminder.
