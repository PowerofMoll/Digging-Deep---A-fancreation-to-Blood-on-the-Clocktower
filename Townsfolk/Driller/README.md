> Each night, choose a player & guess their good character: if correct, they die tomorrow.

*We are almost though, just a little bit more.*

### The Driller drills violently with some precision.
- The Driller chooses a character once, that player must die the next day. If there are multiple copies, all die.
- If the Driller dies that day even by execution and the character they chose hasn't died, they don't have to.
- The Driller can't choose evil characters.

### How to run
Each night, wake the Driller. They point at any player, then point at any character icon on their character sheet. Put the Driller to sleep. If the chosen player is the chosen character icon, mark the player of that character with the **"Accident"** reminder.

At any time during the day decide that the player marked **"Accident"** dies. Immediately declare that the player has died & remove the **"Accident"** reminder.

### Examples
> The Driller chooses the Prospector and the Prospector character. At dusk that day the Deputy is executed and dies as well as the Prospector.

> The Driller chooses the Gargoyle and the Moonshiner character. That day only the player that is executed dies. Because the Gargoyle isn’t the Moonshiner.

> The Driller chooses the Spotter who is protecting themselves and the Spotter character. That day the Spotter would die, but doesn’t due to their ability and the protection moves.
