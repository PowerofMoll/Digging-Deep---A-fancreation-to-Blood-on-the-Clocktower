> Each night, choose a player & guess their good character: if correct, they die tomorrow.

*We are almost though, just a little bit more.*

### The Driller drills violently with some precision.
- The Driller chooses a character once, that player must die the next day. If there are multiple copies, all die.
- If the Driller dies that day even by execution and the character they chose hasn't died, they don't have to.
- The Driller can't choose evil characters.

### How to run
Each night, wake the Driller. They point at any player, then point at any character icon on their character sheet. Put the Driller to sleep. If the chosen player is the chosen character icon, mark the player of that character with the **"Accident"** reminder.

At any time during the day decide that the player marked **"Accident"** dies. Immediately declare that the player has died & remove the **"Accident"** reminder.
