> Once per game, at night, choose a good character: they die tomorrow.

*We are almost though, just a little bit more.*

### The Driller drills violently with some precision.
- The Driller chooses a character once, that player must die the next day. If there are multiple copies, all die.
- If the Driller dies that day even by execution and the character they chose hasn't died, they don't have to.
- The Driller can't choose evil characters.

### How to run
Each night, wake the Driller. They either shake their head no or point at any Townsfolk icon or any Outsider icon on their character sheet. Put the Driller to sleep.

If they pointed to an icon of a character that is in play, mark any players of that character with the **"Accident"** reminder. Either way, mark the Driller with the **No Ability** reminder and remove their night token from the night sheet.
