> Each night*, choose a player: they die. Your alive neighbours might die at any time.

*These terrifying creatures burrow beneath the ground, listening for the sounds of footsteps above. The only mercy offered by these creatures is the tell-tale hiss of their approach, thus allowing would-be victims a moment to prepare for the oncoming attack.*

### The Wurms powerful body can smash and kill anyone.
- As a storyteller generally only kill one of the Wurms neighbours if there is another reason to explain it.
- The Wurm should be used fairly, ending the game or making it unwinnable for the good team to win.
- The Wurm can kill any alive neighbour, skipping any dead neighbours.

### How to run
Each night except the first, wake the Wurm. They point at any player. That player dies - mark them with the **Dead** reminder. Put the Wurm to sleep.

At any time, you may decide that one of the Wurms alive neighbours die. If this is during the day, immediately declare that that player has died. If this is during the night, mark them with the **Dead** reminder and wait until dawn to declare which players died during the night. (Do not say how.)
