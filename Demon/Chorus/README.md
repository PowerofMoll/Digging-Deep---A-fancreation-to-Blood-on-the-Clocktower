> Each night, you learn 3 players & their characters. Each night*, choose a player: they die.

*A dark song shines through the days and nights.*

### The Chrous sees and hears everything fleeting on the wind.
- The Chrous learns a character and which player is it.
- The Chrous can't kill on the first night but still learns characters.

### How to run
Each night, wake the Chrous. Point at a player and show their character, 3 times. If it is the first night put the Chrous to sleep.

Each night except the first, the Chrous point at a player. That player dies - mark them with the **Dead** reminder. Put the Chrous to sleep.
