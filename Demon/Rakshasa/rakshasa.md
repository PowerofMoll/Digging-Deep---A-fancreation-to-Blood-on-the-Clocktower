## Rakshasa

> Each night*, choose a player: they die. You can't die to executions by Townsfolk, except if 3 players live. [+1 Outsider]

*You don't stand a chance against me.*

### The Rakshasa is immune to normal weapons.
- If a Townsfolk nominates the Rakshasa, they can't die by execution that day.
- The Rakshasa adds an Outsider so the good team still has a chance to win before final day.

### How to run
Each night except the first, wake the Rakshasa. They point at any player. That player dies - mark them with the **Dead** reminder. Put the Rakshasa to sleep.

If a Townsfolk nominates the Rakshasa, mark the Rakshasa with **Mundane Weapons**.

If the Rakshasa is executed while marked with **Mundane Weapons**, declare that this player is executed but remains alive. (Do not say why.)

At dusk, remove the **Mundane Weapons** reminder.
