## Aurora

> Each night, you learn 3 players & their characters. Each night*, choose a player: they die.

*The northern light shines brightly over the mountain. It watches over us.*

### The Aurora's light shines brightly revealing those whose life the Aurora can claim.
- The Aurora learns a character and which player is it.
- The Aurora can't kill on the first night but still learns characters.

### How to run
Each night, wake the Aurora. Point at a player and show their character, 3 times. If it is the first night put the Aurora to sleep.

Each night except the first, the Aurora point at a player. That player dies - mark them with the **Dead** reminder. Put the Aurora to sleep.
