> Each night*, choose a player: they die. 1 alive player knows you are in play. If you die, they become an evil Palingenesi.

*Entry 5712: The Palingenesi in an entity found in 1662 in a cave, named after its ability to reform upon destruction. Burning, Crushing, Disolving, and Slashing are just a few methods we have tested, none have worked. We are trying all we can. It won't be contained. I will probably die before the end of the month. My death will hopefully contain it for enough time for a way to destroy it to be found. Someone had to be the sacrifice.*

### The Palingenesi reforms upon its death.
- If the player who knows the Palingenesi dies, an alive player learns it that night.
- As a storyteller you have an important decition to make as for whether you make an evil player learn it is in-play. Allowing it to turn more than 2 players is highly advice against. 
- If the game enters a situation were the good team is unable to win, end the game there and allow the player who knows the Palingenesi to win with evil.

### How to run
On the Palingenesi's first night, wake any player. Show them the Palingenesi character token. Put that player to sleep.

Each night except the first, wake the Palingenesi. They point at any player. That player dies - mark them with the **Dead** reminder. Put the Palingenesi to sleep.

If the Palingenesi dies, the player marked **Know** turns evil and becomes the Palingenesi. (The new Palingenesi now repeats the first paragraph)

If the player who knows the Palingenesi is in play dies while the Palingensi is alive, remove **Know** reminder, wake a new player and show them the Palingensi character token, mark them with the **Know** reminder.
