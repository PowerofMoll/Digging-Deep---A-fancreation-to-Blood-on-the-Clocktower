This was a massive project and I'm so thankful to all who helped me get this far. Thank you so much Indigo, you are a lovely boyfriend, you introduced this whole thing to me and have been an amazing help in making this possible. I was suffering from burnout during this project and having a helping hand beside you really does wonders. In a similar aspect thank you so much Checkmate, you are a great friend and wall to juggle ideas on, rant late at night or show off my work. 

I have had a few who have helped in telling me how to do something! Thank you Dela, you have been such an important part in helping me learn how to draw, both from the help you gave and the inspiration of your work. Thank you DarkArtist and Luis S for helping me learn how to use the art programs i now use. Thank you Alex S for helping me with setting up a copywright licence. Thank you Chum for the template used in creating the script and from that helping me learn how to use the tool.

Thank you Furrow, your enthusiasm has made me feel so good about running the script. Thank you for helping me organise most of the playtests. Thank you to all who have joined these playtests, you have all been wonderful to have in my game. When you have misunderstood, needed help or just played the game, it has helped me provide the patches this script needed to be the best it can be.
