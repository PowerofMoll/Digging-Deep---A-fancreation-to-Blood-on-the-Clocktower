## Forge

> Each night, the Demon might learn this & have the ability "Each night, choose a player: they are poisoned until dusk." instead of their own until dusk. 

*A fate will be smithed together, made from iron and blood.*

### The Forge keeps the game going at a reasonable pace even with many deaths during the day, while providing the Demon with a boon in response.
- At the start of each night, the storyteller may choose that the Demon doesn't have their ability for that night and day, instead they choose a player to be poisoned until the end of that day.
- We recommend using the Forge sparingly, generally decide before the game how often you are intending to use it based on the bag. It is not intended to be used as a balancing tools for players actions during the game.
- Generally don't use the Forge when the Demon does not wake. Also avoid using the ability in games that are already having few deaths as the Forge can make the game slower. Using the Forge when few players live risks players feeling like their win was stolen, so using it earlier in the game is generally recommended.
- The Demon does not have their ability for that full day and night, this includes any abilities that work during the day or night, that are not them choosing a player to die.

### How to run
Each night, you may mark the Demon **Forged** and wake the Demon. Show them **This Character Selected You** then the Forge. The Demon points at any player, mark that player **Poisoned**.

While the Demon is marked **Forged**, they don't have an ability, they do not wake if their token would make them, they cannot survive execution to their token, etc.

Each dusk, remove the **Forged** reminder.

Each dusk, remove the **Poisoned** reminder.
