> If an evil player is executed, tonight, they may guess you: if correct, a player dies before dusk.

*Round and round the place we go. Finding friend and many foe.*

### **The Roamer travels around rousing monsters from their sleep.**
- The executed evil player may guess even if they did not die.
- The evil player wakes immediately to guess.
- The Roamer can kill a dead or protected player to sink the kill though this should generally only be done if it would help evil.
- If the Roamer dies, no players can die from it's ability then on, even guesses made when the Roamer lived.

### How to run

If an evil player is executed, mark them as **Hunting Tonight**.

During that night, wake the player marked **Hunting Tonight**, they point at a player. Put them to sleep. If they pointed at the Roamer, mark the Roamer **Monsters roused**.

If the Roamer is marked **Monsters Roused**, at any point during the day choose a player to die. Immediately declare that the player has died. Remove the **Monsters Roused** reminder. 

At dawn remove the **Hunting Tonight** reminder.

### Examples
> The Vessel is executed and doesnâ€™t die, that night they guess that the Roamer is the Roamer. After 3 nominations the next day, the Surveyor dies.

> The Wraith is executed and dies, that night they guess that the Prospector is the Roamer. Tomorrow nothing special happens.
