> 1 of the Demon's alive good neighbours is drunk.

*Come take a sip, homemade to heighten our spirits.*

### **The Moonshiner hands out drinks... Illegally.**
- The Moonshiner only makes 1 player drunk at a time.
- The 2 closest alive good neighbours of the Demon can be, skipping over dead or evil players.
- If the drunk player dies, only then does a new player become drunk.
- If the Moonshiner dies, the player is no longer drunk.

### How to run
While preparing the first night, mark one of the Demons good neighbours with the Moonshiner’s **Drunk** reminder. This player is drunk.

If the player marked with the Moonshiners **Drunk** reminder dies, turns evil or stops neighbouring the Demon, remove the Moonshiner's **Drunk** reminder. Mark one of the Demons good neighbours with the Moonshiner’s **Drunk** reminder.

### Examples
> The Technician neighbours the Chorus & is drunk due to the Moonshiner. They choose the Panner and the Gargoyle and learn a 4 since they are drunk.

> The Gargoyle neighbours the Geologist and the Wurm, the Geologist is drunk due to the moonshiner. They choose the Moonshiner and the Wurm and learn the Wurm since they are drunk.

> The Rakshasa neighbours the Demolitionist and Driller. The Moonshiner neighbours the Driller. The Moonshiner makes the Demolitionist drunk. The Demolitionist is executed and dies. The Driller becomes drunk.
