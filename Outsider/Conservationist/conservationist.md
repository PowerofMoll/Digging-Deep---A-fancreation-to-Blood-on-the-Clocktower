> Once per game, if a player would die, they don't & another might die instead.

*Leave us alone, don't break this down. Our home is on the line.*

### **The Conservationist tries to make sure the mining operation stops.**
- The Conservationist can prevent a player from dying at any time, day or night.
- When a death is prevented, the storyteller can choose another to die but doesn't have to.
- We reccomend using the ability during the earlier days, using it later can feel unfair as the players had little power to prevent it. 

### How to run

At any time a player dies, you may decide that they don't. Do not declare that this happened. If you do, mark the Conservationist with the **No Ability** reminder. You may also decide that another player dies instead. If this is during the day, immediately declare that the other player has died. If this is during the night, remove the **Dead** reminder that was placed on the protected player and if you chose that another dies, mark them with that **Dead** reminder. Wait until dawn to declare which players died during the night. (Do not say how.)
