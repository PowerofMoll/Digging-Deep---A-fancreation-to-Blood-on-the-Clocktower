> 2 players can't register as their alignment or character to Townsfolk. If you die, tonight, guess them per night: learn correct guesses.

*A part of me for a part of you. Oh, you actually agreed to that? Here have a part of me, an empty part.*

### **The Counterfeiter fakes 2 players but tries to rectify their mistakes at the last moment in their lives.**
- The players who can't register correctly can register as any character but their own and as any alignment but their own.
- The Counterfeiter can guess their players even if they died during the day.
- The Counterfeiter chooses 2 players to guess per night.

### How to run
During setup, mark two players with the Counterfeiterâ€™s **Fake** reminders.

Each time a player marked with the Counterfeiter's **Fake** reminder is targeted by an ability that detects or affects characters or players, choose which character and alignment the marked players register as (not their character or alignment). (Do whatever is appropriate, such as showing a character token, nodding, giving finger signals, or allowing an ability to work that would normally only affect players of other alignments or character.)

If the Counterfeiter dies, mark them **Regretting**.

During that night, wake the Counterfeiter, they point at 2 players per night (one at a time). For each that is marked **Fake** give a 'yes' hand signal and point to them. Put the Counterfeiter to sleep. 

### Example
> The Metallurgist and the Vessel are marked fake from the Counterfeiters ability. The Vessel is executed and does not die. That night the Metallurgist learns Spotter, as the Vessel is registering falsely.

> The Moonshiner neighbours the Technician and the Counterfeiter. The Moonshiner and the Counterfeiter are marked fake from the Counterfeiters ability. The Technician is not drunk as the Counterfeiter cannot make a player register falsely to the Moonshiners ability.
